Reactive Event-Driven Store

Use decorators for creating your own store!

Describe Actions, Reducers and Effects by selecting event-names.

Flux-likely decision that contains simply types and methods to create Event-Driven Asynchronous Storage.

Was tested with Angular-applications.

*** 
Also, you can create ReactiveStateful Component by extending Store class. Then you will get component-store with own state$, patch() etc. It is useful if you have Component with a lot of dynamic data.
